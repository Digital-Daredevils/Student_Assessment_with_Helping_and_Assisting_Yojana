# Student_Assessment_with_Helping_and_Assisting_Yojana
We are developing a web based application which identify the slow learners for remedial teaching and capacity building for innovative methods.

The Project is aiming to build a database to assess students with a few tests and ranking them based on their performance. This input is taken to grade them as the “Type of Learner” so that those who are assessed as “Slow Learners” are listed out to receive proper help and guidance to improve their learnability.
Various Innovative Methods are captured in the system for Capacity Building of the students. These are classified again based on the learner’s category.
A time-table based on the Innovative Learning Methods for slow learners is produced to keep track of their progress and later to assess them using Gap Analysis with quick learners. Based on the outcome of this post learning analysis, the whole cycle is repeated.
