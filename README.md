We are developing a web based application which identify the slow learners for remedial teaching and capacity building for innovative methods.

The Project is aiming to build a database to assess students with a few tests and ranking them based on their performance. This input is taken to grade them as the “Type of Learner” so that those who are assessed as “Slow Learners” are listed out to receive proper help and guidance to improve their learnability.
Various Innovative Methods are captured in the system for Capacity Building of the students. These are classified again based on the learner’s category.
A time-table based on the Innovative Learning Methods for slow learners is produced to keep track of their progress and later to assess them using Gap Analysis with quick learners. Based on the outcome of this post learning analysis, the whole cycle is repeated.

The "SAHAAY" project, initiated under the Ministry of Education, is a pioneering initiative aimed at revolutionizing student assessment and personalized learning. This forward-thinking project's core objective is to identify and support slow learners by building innovative methods tailored to their educational needs.

<u><b>KEY MODULES</u></b>: 

1.<u>Assessment Module</u>: This module employs a multifaceted approach, combining faculty observation, scholastic tests, and in-app assessments to comprehensively evaluate students' performance. 

2.<u>Identification Module</u>: Through the implementation of a Random Forest algorithm, students are categorized as slow learners, medium-paced learners, or quick learners, enabling the customization of learning paths. 

3.<u>Help and Assistance Module</u>: The Help and Assistance Module plays a pivotal role in providing a personalized learning experience. It incorporates innovative learning components, including gamified learning, video-based learning, mood tracking, and micro-learning modules. 

4.<u>Gap and Progress Analysis Module</u>: By conducting a skill gap analysis using the K-Means Clustering algorithm, the project identifies and addresses knowledge and skill gaps among students, ensuring that learning paths are relevant and effective. 

<u><b>ALGORITHMS</b></u>: 

<u>Random Forest Algorithm</u>: Used for ranking and grouping students in the Identification Module, ensuring transparency, robustness, and accuracy in categorizing students as slow, medium, or quick learners. 

<u>K-Means Clustering Algorithm</u>: Applied in the Gap and Progress Analysis Module for identifying skill gaps among students, leading to the creation of relevant learning paths. 

<u>Hybrid Recommender System</u>: Suggested for creating custom learning paths, combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods, taking into account content preferences, past interactions, assessment results, and mood data. 

The Help and Assistance Module is a cornerstone of the "SAHAAY" project. It offers a personalized learning experience through innovative learning components. These components include gamified learning, video-based learning, pictorial-based learning, relaxation periods, mood tracking, and micro-learning modules. 

The integration of these elements provides students with engaging and effective learning opportunities, tailored to their individual criteria, interests, and learning pace. The "SAHAAY" project, driven by a robust tech stack, aligns with the Ministry of Education's commitment to nurturing India's future leaders. It embodies a holistic approach to education, combining advanced technologies, innovative methods, and data-driven decision-making to reduce the learning pace gap and enhance the educational experience for all students.
